.mad files contain wild puppets and other map attributes for a particular area.

"weight": encounter rate relative to other puppets in the same encounter type
percentage calculated by weight divided by sum of weights (within the same encounter type)
Note that the sum of weights seems to determine (or at least influence) the frequency of encounters in general (i.e. how long it takes before you get an encounter while running around in the grass)
If the sum of weights is very low (minimum in vanilla SoD is 28) you run the risk of encounters not spawning at all or taking an eternity to spawn

"tilesets": array of 4 integers indicating tileset IDs used in the map. tilesets are located in gn_dat5/map/chip
"weather": visual effect on the overworld. 0 = none, 1 = darkness, 2 = fog, 3 = red fog, 4 = snow, 5 = cherry blossoms, 6 = heat, 7 = spirits(?), 8 = light orbs, 9 = rain.
"overworld_theme": song id
"battle_background": background id
"encounter_type": 0 = grass encounters, 1 = encounters everywhere (e.g. inside caves)
"forbid_bike": disallow riding the bike on this map (e.g. indoor maps)

"special" encounters are blue grass encounters
