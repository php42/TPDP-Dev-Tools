This file contains definitions for all the skills in the game.
The json should be mostly self-explanatory.

"effect_chance": chance for an effect (e.g. burn) to be applied upon successful hit
"effect_id": id of the effect to be applied

the following fields are speculative and untested:
"effect_target": whether the effect is applied to you or your opponent (0 = self, 1 = opponent, 4 = terrain)
"ynk_id": redundant id field present only in YnK/SoD
