.obs files contain the data for events/objects/etc placed on the map.
it's an array of 1024 20-byte structures.

"index": index into the array
"object_id": overworld sprite for this object
"movement_mode": type of movement (static in different directions, wandering, etc)
"movement_delay": delay between movements (i.e. speed, lower is faster)
"event_arg": depends on 'type'. typically this is the ID of a script file. for warps, it is the id of the map to warp to.
"event_index": depends on 'type'. for warps, this is the event ID to warp to on the other map.
"flags": an array of 12 1-byte values that seem to mostly be boolean flags, though some bytes may contain larger values.
